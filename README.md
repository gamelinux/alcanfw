# alcanfw - A Linux Client Application+Netfilter FireWall 

# This was just something that has been up in my head for a long time.
# Some times Im super paranoid, and I just want to make sure the right
# stuff only talks on to the network. This is not as flexible and cool
# as I dreamt of, but rather a quick script made in 2-3h that will work
# at least for me for now.
#
# This probably wont work on a high traffic host, as this is written
# quick and dirty in an high level programming language... (perl).
# I might write it in C one day :)
#
# Install on Mr. Ubuntu 12.04.1 :
# $ apt-get install libnetpacket-perl libiptables-ipv4-ipqueue-perl
# $ sudo perl alcanfw.pl --verbose
